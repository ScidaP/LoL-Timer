# LoL Timer

I want to create a new tool for League of Legends players. This website will help you track your enemies cooldowns on abilites and some summoners too. 
This project is still in development.

It's quite simple to use. You just have to type which champion you want to track and hit "Ok".
After that, you either press "Q" "W" "E" or "R" in your keyboard or click any of the ability buttons, 
in order to start each timer. Both work fine.

## IMPORTANT

Run npm install
